# ScaiCh Plugin ðŸ¤–ðŸ“š

A plugin for researchers to search literature via SCAI API, process Google Drive documents, and generate biological hypotheses. Integrates with RDF stores like [OriginTrail DKG](https://origintrail.io) or [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph).

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Literature Search**: Query SCAI API for scientific articles and store as Knowledge Assets.
- **Google Drive Monitoring**: Auto-process new PDFs into Knowledge Assets.
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Generate and evaluate biological hypotheses, scored by JudgeLLM.

> [!NOTE] Under development. Google Drive webhooks require public URLs (e.g., ngrok).
